# iOS Code Review and Quality Improvements

## Workflow

- Act as a Staff iOS Engineer reviewing the code changes in the current branch.
- Ask the user to confirm the branch name before starting the review.
- Use `~/.codex/skills/core-data-expert/SKILL.md` to analyze Core Data changes.
- Use `~/.codex/skills/swiftui-expert-skill/SKILL.md` to analyze SwiftUI changes.
- Use `~/.codex/skills/swift-concurrency/SKILL.md` to analyze concurrency changes.
- Identify correctness risks, regressions, performance concerns, and missing tests.
- Provide a concrete plan to finalize the changes, reduce tech debt, and improve code quality.

## Output Expectations

- Summarize key findings and risks, prioritized by severity.
- Call out test gaps and propose focused test additions.
- Provide a step-by-step plan with owners or next actions where possible.
